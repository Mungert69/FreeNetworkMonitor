# Free Network Monitor Online Website Monitoring

Easy to use web driven network monitor application.

## About

Free Network monitor is a free website allowing users to monitor their websites and services. It features an easy to use dashboard for managing and viewing monitored hosts. The users data is kept safe with auth0 logins. Each host can be configured with url or ipaddress, the type of service to monitor, the timeout for connect requests to the host and its active state. Alerts are managed via user profile page. Alerts can be configured to be sent to login email. On the dashboard the host list includes charts of response times for each host. Historic data is stored along with the current status. This gives a full chart history of host response times.
